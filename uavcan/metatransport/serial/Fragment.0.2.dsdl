# A chunk of raw bytes exchanged over a serial transport. Serial links do not support framing natively.
# The chunk may be of arbitrary size.

# If this data type is used to encapsulate UAVCAN/serial, then it is recommended to ensure that each message
# contains at most one UAVCAN/serial transport frame (frames are separated by zero-valued delimiter bytes).
