# This is like UDP, except that the modem nodes will not expect and therefore will not
# reverse-forward any data back from the remote host. This protocol is recommended for use
# for one-way communications, such as telemetry transmissions.
#
# Please refer to the UDP protocol definition for a detailed overview. All parts of the
# definition pertaining to reverse forwarding do not apply.
