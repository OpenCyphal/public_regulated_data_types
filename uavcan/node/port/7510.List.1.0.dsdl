# A list of ports that this node is using:
# - Subjects published by this node (whether periodically or ad-hoc).
# - Subjects that this node is subscribed to (a datalogger or a debugger would typically subscribe to all subjects).
# - RPC services consumed by this node (i.e., service clients).
# - RPC services provided by this node (i.e., service servers).
#
# All nodes should implement this capability to provide network introspection and diagnostic capabilities.
# This message should be published using the fixed subject-ID as follows:
# - At the OPTIONAL priority level at least every MAX_PUBLICATION_PERIOD seconds.
# - At the OPTIONAL or SLOW priority level within MAX_PUBLICATION_PERIOD after the port configuration is changed.

uint8 MAX_PUBLICATION_PERIOD = 10  # [seconds]
# If the port configuration is not updated in this amount of time, the node should publish this message anyway.
