# This low-rate battery status should be published at least once per second.

# Note that the health code generally should not reflect the battery charge unless the service provider knows
# that the availability of energy in the battery is critical for the safe operation of the vehicle, which is usually
# not the case. For example, if the vehicle is equipped with several batteries that are discharged in series, one
# after another, the depletion of energy in the first battery is not a fault condition and it should not be reported
# as such. This follows from the good service design principles reviewed in https://uavcan.org/guide.
#
# The readiness state depicts the ability of the battery (or its power electronics) to deliver full rated power
# and whether the overdischarge protections are active.
# When the battery is not ENGAGED, it may limit the output power below the nominal rated value and disconnect the load
# should the charge level fall below the critical level.
# When the battery is ENGAGED, it is not permitted to limit the output power or energy regardless of the risk of damage.
# If the adaptive protection is not supported, the battery should always report its status as ENGAGED.

uavcan.si.unit.temperature.Scalar.1.0[2] temperature_min_max
# The minimum and maximum readings of the pack temperature sensors.
# For example, if the pack is equipped with three distributed temperature sensors that read {288, 258.15, 360.5} K,
# the reported array value would be {258.15, 360.5} K.
# If there is only one temperature sensor, both elements shall be of the same value.

uavcan.si.unit.electric_charge.Scalar.1.0 available_charge
# The estimated electric charge currently stored in the battery. This is intended for charging and maintenance only.
# Do not use this parameter for endurance prediction! Instead, use the correct energy type from the physics namespace.
# The depth of discharge (DoD), or the state of charge (SoC), can be derived by dividing this value by the
# nominal battery capacity reported in the Parameters message.
