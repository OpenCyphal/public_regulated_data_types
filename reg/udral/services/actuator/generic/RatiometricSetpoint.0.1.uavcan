# Ratiometric setpoint for UDRAL actuators, including servo motors and electronic speed controllers (ESCs).
# Commands an actuator to a specified fraction of its maximum drive capability.
# Values are normalized between -8191 and 8192. 8192 represents maximum drive (RPM, deflection, etc) in the positive direction, while -8192 represents maximum drive in the negative direction.
